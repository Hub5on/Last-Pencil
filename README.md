# Last Pencil Game
This is a Java command-line application that simulates the Last Pencil game between two players: John and Jack. The game involves taking turns removing 1, 2, or 3 pencils from a pile, with the aim of forcing the opponent to take the last pencil.

# Features
- Pencil Removal: Players take turns removing 1, 2, or 3 pencils from the pile.
- Smart Strategies: Each player has a different strategy - John follows a systematic approach, while Jack incorporates a partly random strategy.
- Game Continuity: The game continues until no pencils remain, declaring the player who takes the last pencil as the loser.

# How to Play
### 1. Running the Game:
- Compile the Java file (Main.java) using javac Main.java.
- Run the compiled file using java Main.
### 2. Game Rules:
